## Inspiration
As students, we experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating the vast ocean of resources to find answers to our questions. However, each search often led to more confusion and frustration as we struggled to find reliable explanations tailored to our personal needs. It became evident that there was a pressing need for an intuitive and efficient solution to streamline the process of knowledge acquisition.

## What it does
Intuitscape is an e-learning platform where users input topic of interest, select related sub-topics, and depth of explanation generated based on their level of education. Then, Intuitscape generates concept maps that users can freely explore. These concept maps serve as interactive visualizations of interconnected topics and allows users to either navigate through related concepts in a designed order or explore their relationships at their own pace.

## How we built it
Intuitscape was constructed utilizing JavaScript libraries (React, React Flow) and Vite. The backend of Intuitscape is powered by Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, while the frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Integration with Google Vertex AI provides natural language processing and generative AI capabilities by enhancing the platform's ability to generate personalized learning content.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of Intuitscape, we encountered several challenges that tested our skills and perseverance. Fine-tuning the AI algorithms to deliver accurate and relevant content personalized to each user's needs was a complex task. Integrating the frontend and backend components while ensuring smooth communication and data exchange were additional challenges since we need to optimize performance and handle large volumes of user requests. To overcome this obstacles, we deployed specific plan which aimed at maximizing the comprehensiveness of our product within the constraints of our timeline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Apart from the challenges we met, we are proud of what we have achieved with Intuitscape. One of our major accomplishments is successfully implementing advanced generative AI technology to personalize the learning experience for users. We are also proud of the successful integration of image prompts into Intuitscape's concept map generation feature. This groundbreaking addition allows users to input images as prompts and Intuitscape, implemented by advanced generative AI technology, generates concept maps based on visual cues. These accomplishments represents a significant milestone in our journey to create a truly immersive and personalized learning platform.

## What we learned
Building Intuitscape has been a valuable learning experience for our team, providing insights into the complexities of developing a sophisticated e-learning platform and leveraging AI technology to enhance the learning experience. We've learned valuable technical skills in web development, AI integration, and software architecture, as well as soft skills in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.

## What's next for Intuitscape
Looking ahead, our vision for Intuitscape is to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in e-learning by incorporating even more advanced AI capabilities. Our goal is to evolve Intuitscape into a platform resembles Prezi but enhanced with AI by offering dynamic and interactive presentations that adapt to the user's preferences and learning objectives in real-time. With ongoing research and development, we're excited to bring this vision to life and empower learners worldwide to explore, discover, and learn in entirely new ways.
